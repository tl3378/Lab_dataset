"Towards Fair RAG: On the Impact of Fair Ranking in Retrieval-Augmented
 Generation","To Eun Kim, Fernando Diaz",2024-09-17T23:10:04Z,RAG,"Many language models now enhance their responses with retrieval capabilities, leading to the widespread adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, despite retrieval being a core component of RAG, much of the research in this area overlooks the extensive body of work on fair ranking, neglecting the importance of considering all stakeholders involved. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems integrated with fair rankings. We focus specifically on measuring the fair exposure of each relevant item across the rankings utilized by RAG systems (i.e., item-side fairness), aiming to promote equitable growth for relevant item providers. To gain a deep understanding of the relationship between item-fairness, ranking quality, and generation quality in the context of RAG, we analyze nine different RAG systems that incorporate fair rankings across seven distinct datasets. Our findings indicate that RAG systems with fair rankings can maintain a high level of generation quality and, in many cases, even outperform traditional RAG systems, despite the general trend of a tradeoff between ensuring fairness and maintaining system-effectiveness. We believe our insights lay the groundwork for responsible and equitable RAG systems and open new avenues for future research. ",To Eun Kim,4, Fernando Diaz,51
"Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Beyond: A Comprehensive Survey
 on How to Make your LLMs use External Data More Wisely","Siyun Zhao, Yuqing Yang, Zilong Wang, Zhiyuan He, Luna K. Qiu, Lili Qiu",2024-09-23T11:20:20Z,"Retrieval Augmented Generation, RAG","Large language models (LLMs) augmented with external data have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in completing real-world tasks. Techniques for integrating external data into LLMs, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning, are gaining increasing attention and widespread application. Nonetheless, the effective deployment of data-augmented LLMs across various specialized fields presents substantial challenges. These challenges encompass a wide range of issues, from retrieving relevant data and accurately interpreting user intent to fully harnessing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for complex tasks. We believe that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for data-augmented LLM applications. In practice, underperformance often arises from a failure to correctly identify the core focus of a task or because the task inherently requires a blend of multiple capabilities that must be disentangled for better resolution. In this survey, we propose a RAG task categorization method, classifying user queries into four levels based on the type of external data required and primary focus of the task: explicit fact queries, implicit fact queries, interpretable rationale queries, and hidden rationale queries. We define these levels of queries, provide relevant datasets, and summarize the key challenges and most effective techniques for addressing these challenges. Finally, we discuss three main forms of integrating external data into LLMs: context, small model, and fine-tuning, highlighting their respective strengths, limitations, and the types of problems they are suited to solve. This work aims to help readers thoroughly understand and decompose the data requirements and key bottlenecks in building LLM applications, offering solutions to the different challenges and serving as a guide to systematically developing such applications.",Siyun Zhao,N/A,Yuqing Yang,16
"GenAI-powered Multi-Agent Paradigm for Smart Urban Mobility:
 Opportunities and Challenges for Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and
 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Intelligent Transportation Systems","Haowen Xu, Jinghui Yuan, Anye Zhou, Guanhao Xu, Wan Li, Xuegang Ban, Xinyue Ye",2024-08-31T16:14:42Z,RAG,"Leveraging recent advances in generative AI, multi-agent systems are increasingly being developed to enhance the functionality and efficiency of smart city applications. This paper explores the transformative potential of large language models (LLMs) and emerging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), paving the way for innovative solutions to address critical challenges in urban mobility. We begin by providing a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in mobility data, ITS, and Connected Vehicles (CV) applications. Building on this review, we discuss the rationale behind RAG and examine the opportunities for integrating these Generative AI (GenAI) technologies into the smart mobility sector. We propose a conceptual framework aimed at developing multi-agent systems capable of intelligently and conversationally delivering smart mobility services to urban commuters, transportation operators, and decision-makers. Our approach seeks to foster an autonomous and intelligent approach that (a) promotes science-based advisory to reduce traffic congestion, accidents, and carbon emissions at multiple scales, (b) facilitates public education and engagement in participatory mobility management, and (c) automates specialized transportation management tasks and the development of critical ITS platforms, such as data analytics and interpretation, knowledge representation, and traffic simulations. By integrating LLM and RAG, our approach seeks to overcome the limitations of traditional rule-based multi-agent systems, which rely on fixed knowledge bases and limited reasoning capabilities. This integration paves the way for a more scalable, intuitive, and automated multi-agent paradigm, driving advancements in ITS and urban mobility.",Haowen Xu,7,Jinghui Yuan,32
"A RAG Approach for Generating Competency Questions in Ontology
 Engineering","Xueli Pan, Jacco van Ossenbruggen, Victor de Boer, Zhisheng Huang",2024-09-13T13:34:32Z,"RAG, Ontology","Competency question (CQ) formulation is central to several ontology development and evaluation methodologies. Traditionally, the task of crafting these competency questions heavily relies on the effort of domain experts and knowledge engineers which is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there arises the possibility to automate and enhance this process. Unlike other similar works which use existing ontologies or knowledge graphs as input to LLMs, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that uses LLMs for the automatic generation of CQs given a set of scientific papers considered to be a domain knowledge base. We investigate its performance and specifically, we study the impact of different number of papers to the RAG and different temperature setting of the LLM. We conduct experiments using GPT-4 on two domain ontology engineering tasks and compare results against ground-truth CQs constructed by domain experts. Empirical assessments on the results, utilizing evaluation metrics (precision and consistency), reveal that compared to zero-shot prompting, adding relevant domain knowledge to the RAG improves the performance of LLMs on generating CQs for concrete ontology engineering tasks.",Xueli Pan,3,Jacco van Ossenbruggen,38
"LA-RAG:Enhancing LLM-based ASR Accuracy with Retrieval-Augmented
 Generation","Shaojun Li, Hengchao Shang, Daimeng Wei, Jiaxin Guo, Zongyao Li, Xianghui He, Min Zhang, Hao Yang",2024-09-13T07:28:47Z,RAG,"Recent advancements in integrating speech information into large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy. However, existing methods often constrained by the capabilities of the speech encoders under varied acoustic conditions, such as accents. To address this, we propose LA-RAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm for LLM-based ASR. LA-RAG leverages fine-grained token-level speech datastores and a speech-to-speech retrieval mechanism to enhance ASR accuracy via LLM in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Experiments on Mandarin and various Chinese dialect datasets demonstrate significant improvements in ASR accuracy compared to existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach, especially in handling accent variations.",Shaojun Li,5,Hengchao Shang,9
Trustworthiness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems: A Survey,"Yujia Zhou, Yan Liu, Xiaoxi Li, Jiajie Jin, Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu, Chaozhuo Li, Zhicheng Dou, Tsung-Yi Ho, Philip S. Yu",2024-09-16T09:06:44Z,Other,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has quickly grown into a pivotal paradigm in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). While much of the current research in this field focuses on performance optimization, particularly in terms of accuracy and efficiency, the trustworthiness of RAG systems remains an area still under exploration. From a positive perspective, RAG systems are promising to enhance LLMs by providing them with useful and up-to-date knowledge from vast external databases, thereby mitigating the long-standing problem of hallucination. While from a negative perspective, RAG systems are at the risk of generating undesirable contents if the retrieved information is either inappropriate or poorly utilized. To address these concerns, we propose a unified framework that assesses the trustworthiness of RAG systems across six key dimensions: factuality, robustness, fairness, transparency, accountability, and privacy. Within this framework, we thoroughly review the existing literature on each dimension. Additionally, we create the evaluation benchmark regarding the six dimensions and conduct comprehensive evaluations for a variety of proprietary and open-source models. Finally, we identify the potential challenges for future research based on our investigation results. Through this work, we aim to lay a structured foundation for future investigations and provide practical insights for enhancing the trustworthiness of RAG systems in real-world applications.",Yujia Zhou,12,Yan Liu,97
MoRAG -- Multi-Fusion Retrieval Augmented Generation for Human Motion,"Kalakonda Sai Shashank, Shubh Maheshwari, Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla",2024-09-18T17:03:30Z,"Retrieval Augmented Generation, RAG","We introduce MoRAG, a novel multi-part fusion based retrieval-augmented generation strategy for text-based human motion generation. The method enhances motion diffusion models by leveraging additional knowledge obtained through an improved motion retrieval process. By effectively prompting large language models (LLMs), we address spelling errors and rephrasing issues in motion retrieval. Our approach utilizes a multi-part retrieval strategy to improve the generalizability of motion retrieval across the language space. We create diverse samples through the spatial composition of the retrieved motions. Furthermore, by utilizing low-level, part-specific motion information, we can construct motion samples for unseen text descriptions. Our experiments demonstrate that our framework can serve as a plug-and-play module, improving the performance of motion diffusion models.",Kalakonda Sai Shashank,2,Shubh Maheshwari,4
"Familiarity-aware Evidence Compression for Retrieval Augmented
 Generation","Dongwon Jung, Qin Liu, Tenghao Huang, Ben Zhou, Muhao Chen",2024-09-19T05:14:55Z,Other,"Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves large language models (LMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge through evidence retrieval from external sources. However, it often struggles to filter out inconsistent and irrelevant information that can distract the LM from its tasks. While compressing the retrieved evidence with a compression model aims to address this issue, the compressed evidence may still be unfamiliar to the target model used for downstream task, potentially failing to utilize the evidence effectively. We propose FaviComp (Familiarity-aware Evidence Compression), a novel training-free evidence compression technique that makes retrieved evidence more familiar to the target model, while seamlessly integrating parametric knowledge from the model. Specifically, FaviComp proactively lowers the perplexity of the compressed evidence with regard to the target model by combining token probabilities from both the compression model and the target model to generate context that is more familiar to the target model. This approach balances the integration of parametric and non-parametric knowledge, which is especially helpful in complex tasks where the retrieved evidence set may not contain all the necessary information. Experimental results demonstrate that FaviComp consistently outperforms existing baselines in multiple open-domain QA datasets, achieving high compression rates and showcasing the effective integration of both parametric and non-parametric knowledge.",Dongwon Jung,1,Qin Liu,35
GEM-RAG: Graphical Eigen Memories For Retrieval Augmented Generation,"Brendan Hogan Rappazzo, Yingheng Wang, Aaron Ferber, Carla Gomes",2024-09-23T21:42:47Z,"Retrieval Augmented Generation, RAG","The ability to form, retrieve, and reason about memories in response to stimuli serves as the cornerstone for general intelligence - shaping entities capable of learning, adaptation, and intuitive insight. Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven their ability, given the proper memories or context, to reason and respond meaningfully to stimuli. However, they are still unable to optimally encode, store, and retrieve memories - the ability to do this would unlock their full ability to operate as AI agents, and to specialize to niche domains. To remedy this, one promising area of research is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which aims to augment LLMs by providing them with rich in-context examples and information. In question-answering (QA) applications, RAG methods embed the text of interest in chunks, and retrieve the most relevant chunks for a prompt using text embeddings. Motivated by human memory encoding and retrieval, we aim to improve over standard RAG methods by generating and encoding higher-level information and tagging the chunks by their utility to answer questions. We introduce Graphical Eigen Memories For Retrieval Augmented Generation (GEM-RAG). GEM-RAG works by tagging each chunk of text in a given text corpus with LLM generated ``utility'' questions, connecting chunks in a graph based on the similarity of both their text and utility questions, and then using the eigendecomposition of the memory graph to build higher level summary nodes that capture the main themes of the text. We evaluate GEM-RAG, using both UnifiedQA and GPT-3.5 Turbo as the LLMs, with SBERT, and OpenAI's text encoders on two standard QA tasks, showing that GEM-RAG outperforms other state-of-the-art RAG methods on these tasks. We also discuss the implications of having a robust RAG system and future directions.",Brendan Hogan Rappazzo,12,Yingheng Wang,8
"Controlling Risk of Retrieval-augmented Generation: A Counterfactual
 Prompting Framework","Lu Chen, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Yixing Fan, Xueqi Cheng",2024-09-24T14:52:14Z,Other,"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular solution to mitigate the hallucination issues of large language models. However, existing studies on RAG seldom address the issue of predictive uncertainty, i.e., how likely it is that a RAG model's prediction is incorrect, resulting in uncontrollable risks in real-world applications. In this work, we emphasize the importance of risk control, ensuring that RAG models proactively refuse to answer questions with low confidence. Our research identifies two critical latent factors affecting RAG's confidence in its predictions: the quality of the retrieved results and the manner in which these results are utilized. To guide RAG models in assessing their own confidence based on these two latent factors, we develop a counterfactual prompting framework that induces the models to alter these factors and analyzes the effect on their answers. We also introduce a benchmarking procedure to collect answers with the option to abstain, facilitating a series of experiments. For evaluation, we introduce several risk-related metrics and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",Lu Chen,83,Ruqing Zhang,18
Corpus-informed Retrieval Augmented Generation of Clarifying Questions,"Antonios Minas Krasakis, Andrew Yates, Evangelos Kanoulas",2024-09-27T09:20:42Z,Retrieval Augmented Generation,"This study aims to develop models that generate corpus informed clarifying questions for web search, in a way that ensures the questions align with the available information in the retrieval corpus. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RAG) in this process, emphasising their ability to (i) jointly model the user query and retrieval corpus to pinpoint the uncertainty and ask for clarifications end-to-end and (ii) model more evidence documents, which can be used towards increasing the breadth of the questions asked. However, we observe that in current datasets search intents are largely unsupported by the corpus, which is problematic both for training and evaluation. This causes question generation models to ``hallucinate'', ie. suggest intents that are not in the corpus, which can have detrimental effects in performance. To address this, we propose dataset augmentation methods that align the ground truth clarifications with the retrieval corpus. Additionally, we explore techniques to enhance the relevance of the evidence pool during inference, but find that identifying ground truth intents within the corpus remains challenging. Our analysis suggests that this challenge is partly due to the bias of current datasets towards clarification taxonomies and calls for data that can support generating corpus-informed clarifications.","Antonios Minas Krasakis, Andrew Yates",3,Andrew Yates,NA

"Multi-source Stable Variable Importance Measure via Adversarial Machine
 Learning","Zitao Wang, Nian Si, Zijian Guo, Molei Liu",2024-09-11T16:13:20Z,Other,"As part of enhancing the interpretability of machine learning, it is of renewed interest to quantify and infer the predictive importance of certain exposure covariates. Modern scientific studies often collect data from multiple sources with distributional heterogeneity. Thus, measuring and inferring stable associations across multiple environments is crucial in reliable and generalizable decision-making. In this paper, we propose MIMAL, a novel statistical framework for Multi-source stable Importance Measure via Adversarial Learning. MIMAL measures the importance of some exposure variables by maximizing the worst-case predictive reward over the source mixture. Our framework allows various machine learning methods for confounding adjustment and exposure effect characterization. For inferential analysis, the asymptotic normality of our introduced statistic is established under a general machine learning framework that requires no stronger learning accuracy conditions than those for single source variable importance. Numerical studies with various types of data generation setups and machine learning implementation are conducted to justify the finite-sample performance of MIMAL. We also illustrate our method through a real-world study of Beijing air pollution in multiple locations.",Zitao Wang,NA,Nian Si,NA
